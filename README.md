# LPinR
This repository will have material to study and implement Linear Programming using R.
<br/><br/>
## Folders
### Simple Example
This folder contains my first implementation of Linear Programming in R and, besides that, a pdf that shows how to solve the problem graphically.

### Math Modeling
This folder contains some basics ideas for modeling a LP problem, how to create our model and a basic implementation in R.
<br/>

### Optimization problems
This folder contains some famous optimization problems, already has () problems and will contain examples of mix, diet, cut, financial and project programation problems.
