# LPinR
This repository will have material to study and implement Linear Programming using R.
<br/><br/>
## Folders
### Simple Example
This folder contains my first implementation of Linear Programming in R and, besides that, a pdf that shows how to solve the problem graphically.  
<br/>
## Math Modelling
This folder contains some basics idea for modelling a LP problem, how to create our model and a basic implementation in R.
